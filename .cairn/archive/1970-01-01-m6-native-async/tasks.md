## Phase 1: Implementation

- [x] [serial] Select compatible native async pins using a compiled independent peer, with explicit unsupported combinations. r[WI-ASYNC-01]
- [x] [parallel] Extend direct-style typed WIT compilation and recursive live-value eligibility without new guest syntax. r[WI-ASYNC-04]
- [x] [parallel] Implement the complete serialized five-state lifecycle, exact input/result/pin disposition and invalid-pair rejections. r[RA-ASYNC-03]
- [x] [serial] Bound admission, terminal reservations, retained payloads, buffered bytes, wakeups, pins and retirement work. r[RA-ASYNC-05]
- [x] [serial] Preserve H-AUTH-03 one-shot witness consumption and separate resource transfer at the same admission boundary. r[RA-ASYNC-02]
- [x] [serial] Preserve H-RECEIPT-01 by distinguishing late authenticated operation receipts from cancelled invocation outcomes without restored owners or retry authority. r[RA-ASYNC-04]
- [x] [serial] Exercise interruption under continuously runnable guest work and isolated blocking native work. r[RA-ASYNC-05]

## Phase 2: Acceptance

- [x] [serial] Execute compiled WI-11 ordering, WI-12 terminal cases and WI-16 recursive eligibility through the independent peer. r[WI-ASYNC-05]
- [x] [serial] Exercise both cancellation/delivery orders, ready resources, domain errors, closure/cancellation, quota failures, abnormal exits and late/stale/duplicate events. r[RA-ASYNC-04]
- [x] [serial] Retain DX-PROTOCOL-03 exact-schema complete lifecycle coverage with invalid-pair and changed-schema controls. r[RA-ASYNC-03]
- [x] [serial] Refine actual production Rust lifecycle decisions under VT-SCOPE-02 through Charon, Aeneas and Lean with compiled dependency/axiom audits. r[RA-ASYNC-03]
- [x] [serial] Renew VT-SCOPE-03 complete source accounting and explicitly distinguish open bodies, extraction, proved correspondence and trusted host assumptions. r[RA-ASYNC-05]
- [x] [serial] Preserve WI-RES-04 by running M5 and earlier regressions, unchanged deny-all/architecture gates and all declared Nix checks. r[WI-ASYNC-05]
- [x] [serial] Retain source/configuration-bound acceptance, update canonical and supporting records, synchronize and archive only after passing gates. r[WI-ASYNC-05]
