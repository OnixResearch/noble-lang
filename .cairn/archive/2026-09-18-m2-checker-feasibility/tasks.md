# M2 implementation tasks

All tasks are open. Package validation does not complete an implementation task.
Each phase starts after the previous phase passes its required checks.
All commands use the dedicated implementation worktree as the explicit root.
The [fragment and schema](design.md) fix the exact scope; every control keeps its fragment label.

## Phase 1: Baseline, fragment, and schema

- [x] [serial] 1.1 Run the document baseline and the three Cairn gates. Record the exact commands, outcomes, and the independent M2 acceptance scope. r[VT-M2-01] r[VT-M2-04]
- [x] [serial] 1.2 Fix the named fragment definition and the versioned candidate schema: node forms, environment contracts, instantiation witnesses, limits, and the five-way outcome domain. r[VT-M2-01]
- [x] [serial] 1.3 Map every fragment rule and declared limit to its positive, boundary, exhausted, and rejection control, including the B-CHECK-06 branch rules. r[VT-M2-01] r[VT-M2-04]

## Phase 2: Kernel acceptance representation

- [x] [serial] 2.1 Add domain-specific kernel types separating identities, untrusted candidates, checked interfaces, and accepted programs, with no bypassing constructor or decoder. r[VT-M2-02]
- [x] [serial] 2.2 Implement the finite acceptance rules: node derivations, instantiation verification, stack joins, effect propagation and inclusion, recursive eligibility, and branch joins. r[VT-M2-01]
- [x] [serial] 2.3 Implement fragment diagnostics that name the failing word or join, required and actual stacks, and the violated effect or eligibility constraint, reporting unavailable provenance as such. r[VT-M2-01]
- [x] [serial] 2.4 Implement the declared limits with fail-closed accounting and the distinguishable outcome domain before each bounded step. r[VT-M2-01]
- [x] [serial] 2.5 Add kernel tests and the CLI acceptance harness for the fragment, covering branch joins, eligibility negatives, effect inclusion, and rejection-without-execution. r[VT-M2-01]

## Phase 3: Extraction and coverage

- [x] [serial] 3.1 Extend the extraction subject to the M2 representation and validation function inside the confirmed extraction subset, retaining failed probes. r[VT-M2-02]
- [x] [serial] 3.2 Bind the generated module to the actual source, inventory, selection, and tool identities, and compile it under the pinned backend. r[VT-M2-02]
- [x] [serial] 3.3 Extend the reviewed classification and coverage gate to every M2 function with separate extracted, proved, modeled, excepted, and open status. r[VT-M2-04]

## Phase 4: Reference model and refinement

- [x] [serial] 4.1 Add the proofs/m2 Lake root with the reference types, schemes, eligibility, effect sets, and request data, independent of the extracted implementation. r[VT-M2-03]
- [x] [serial] 4.2 State the declarative judgment and prove reference-checker soundness in the required acceptance-theorem shape for the fragment. r[VT-M2-03]
- [x] [serial] 4.3 Prove termination on the finite fragment under the declared limits and establish positive acceptance coverage. r[VT-M2-03]
- [x] [serial] 4.4 Prove that the extracted functions compute the reference checker's outcomes for the fragment, relating acceptance to derivable judgments. r[VT-M2-03]
- [x] [serial] 4.5 Add the proof-required gate: a missing proof, a proof hole, an unexplained external model, and a substituted or reduced subject each reject. r[VT-M2-04]

## Phase 5: Developer-experience controls

- [x] [serial] 5.1 Add the bounded property harness with independent acceptance of generated candidates, bounded shrinking that preserves the failure predicate, and a separate malformed-candidate lane. r[VT-M2-01]
- [x] [serial] 5.2 Add static documentation-example checks that run the actual checker, retain failures, and distinguish illustrative text from executed evidence. r[VT-M2-01]
- [x] [serial] 5.3 Cover the three DX-01 negative diagnostic cases as controls over the fragment diagnostics. r[VT-M2-01]

## Phase 6: Acceptance and lifecycle

- [x] [serial] 6.1 Run the full control matrix, retain evidence for every fragment rule, limit, and refusal, and keep the M1 reference checks green. r[VT-M2-04]
- [x] [serial] 6.2 Update the scope review, evidence records, and obligation ledger entries for the exact fragment claims; every other obligation stays open. r[VT-M2-03] r[VT-M2-04]
- [x] [serial] 6.3 Execute the spec sync, archive with an explicit date, commit, push, and integrate without a force-push after acceptance. r[VT-M2-04]

## After Task Completion

These lifecycle actions follow the completed implementation checklist. They are not prerequisites for marking their own completion.

1. Run the archive dry-run and inspect its plan.
2. If the plan is unblocked, execute archive with an explicit archive date.
3. Run Cairn validation and commit the completed change.
4. Push the verified branch and integrate it into `origin/main` without a force-push.
5. Before worktree removal, run the drain-evidence guard and preserve any owner-only evidence outside the worktree.
