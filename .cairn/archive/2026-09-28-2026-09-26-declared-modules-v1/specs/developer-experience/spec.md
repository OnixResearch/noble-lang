# Bounded post-M4 declaration/module profile

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: DX-TYPE-01
r[DX-TYPE-01]

Distinct declared type identities MUST NOT unify merely because their representations match. `Declared-Modules-v1` selects real guest source declarations (`opaque` and two-constructor `variant`), resolved immutable module/version/declaration identities, visibility-controlled constructors and explicit conversions. A source declaration cannot be represented only by structured checker fixtures or erased into structural `I64`/`Sum` for acceptance. Public type export does not expose private construction or representation. The module interface freezes its source version and resolved dependency identities; implementation-local identity is not a portable package hash. The Core-Bootstrap profile is unchanged.

#### Scenario: DX-03 nominal source checking

- GIVEN actual `Declared-Modules-v1` source modules declaring `UserId` and `OrderId` over `I64`, plus private and public constructors
- WHEN the source passes immutable resolution, type inference and independent kernel acceptance
- THEN different nominal identities cannot unify, matching identities can, and a foreign module cannot invoke a private constructor; static checking starts zero guest calls

### Requirement: DX-TYPE-02
r[DX-TYPE-02]

A variant match MUST cover both constructors of its resolved immutable schema. The schema owner may match private arms; an external caller MAY match only when both constructors and their payload interfaces are public/exported. Exporting the variant type alone MUST NOT expose a private arm or payload; an owner may instead export its own checked eliminator. Each admitted typed branch receives its constructor's payload, agrees on the complete ordered result stack and conservatively joins latent effects. A partial/mismatched match or foreign private-arm match MUST fail before execution. Eligibility MUST inspect every nested payload and representation of a nominal wrapper or variant, including an opaque resource-containing wrapper, and MUST reject duplication, discard, capture and serialization whenever recursive eligibility fails. Only a validated resource kind may enter the static fixture; that fixture does not assert resource-positive Wasm support.

#### Scenario: DX-03 exhaustive and resource eligibility

- GIVEN actual source declarations of a two-constructor variant with a private arm, an all-public variant and an opaque wrapper containing an explicitly validated resource kind
- WHEN each complete/incomplete match and dup/drop/quotation capture is checked by the independent kernel
- THEN the owner or an external all-public caller can complete the matching-stack match; missing or mismatched branches, a foreign private-arm match and forbidden resource operations are rejected, and no guest or protected host operation starts

### Requirement: DX-MODULE-01
r[DX-MODULE-01]

`Declared-Modules-v1` source modules MUST explicitly declare exports and required operations and resolve source-versioned imports against an explicitly supplied immutable registry. Source/text bytes remain UTF-8, while declared identifiers are ASCII; a non-ASCII declaration name MUST reject rather than silently normalize. Scoped `@` version notation and generic type commas do not expand Core-Bootstrap's ordinary word grammar. Linking MUST validate exact ordered operation signatures, conservative effect bounds, visibility and resolved dependencies before publication. A module body contains declarations only: top-level execution, initializer or import-time host/guest invocation MUST be rejected, not merely deferred behind an unchecked shim. A source file is an explicitly supplied compiler input; optional bounded compiler-shell file reading is not a guest effect. Package registry, remote transport and portable encoding remain outside this profile.

#### Scenario: DX-08 zero-execution linking

- GIVEN a source module requiring `test.emit : Text -- ! {test.emit}` and a separately supplied typed adapter binding
- WHEN matching, missing, wrong-input, wrong-effect and initializer variants undergo actual module link admission
- THEN only the matching binding links, all others reject, no guest or host request executes, no protected operation occurs and no authority is acquired

### Requirement: DX-MODULE-02
r[DX-MODULE-02]

A module requirement or supplied binding MUST NOT be a host credential. The linked checked program MUST retain immutable module/version, operation and selected adapter identities even if a display alias is rebound. Absent, incompatible and denied bindings MUST NOT fall back to an ambient host operation. At runtime the real compiled Noble/Wasm guest request MUST reach independent host authorization; denied requests remain in declared effect/request accounting but perform no protected work. Link-time checks MUST NOT themselves authorize or invoke the host adapter. Exact module transport and unavailable operation contracts MUST fail explicitly.

#### Scenario: DX-08 link without authority

- GIVEN the declared source requirement and explicit adapter contracts, with a host policy that has not granted access
- WHEN the source module is imported and linked
- THEN matching binding admission occurs without guest or host execution; missing or incompatible bindings reject without fallback or acquired authority

#### Scenario: DX-09 retained A and independent denial

- GIVEN a checked compiled program resolved to version-A module/adapter, a later display-name rebind to version B, and an independent host denial of `test.emit`
- WHEN the earlier compiled Noble/Wasm program executes once
- THEN its one version-A request is recorded and denied, `test.emit` remains in the checked effect set, zero protected operations execute and version B receives no call
