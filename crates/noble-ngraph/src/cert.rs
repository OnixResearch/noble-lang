//! Replayable certificates for a small set of pure `I64` graph rewrites.
//!
//! The transformation stays untrusted. A certificate names, per rewritten node, the
//! rule identity, the ordered operand identities, and the constant bits and claim each
//! rule requires in canonical form. [`check`] validates those premises against the
//! original graph without calling the emitter, replays the folds on a copy of the
//! original and requires the resulting graph to equal that replay, and endpoint digests
//! bind the exact original and resulting graphs. A digest alone binds the result the
//! producer named, not the result the steps produce, so the replay is what refuses a
//! substituted result. Refusals are typed rather than folded into one failure.
//!
//! A derivation also binds the semantic model revision it was produced against
//! ([`MODEL_REVISION`], the IR's `ngraph-sem/0`), so a checker for another model refuses
//! it instead of silently applying rules proved under different arithmetic. [`encode`]
//! and [`decode`] transport a derivation as the token envelope modelled in
//! `proofs/foundation/NobleFoundation/CertificateCodec.lean`: a revision token, a model
//! token, a declared step count and then exactly seven decimal tokens per step. The
//! decoder refuses a stale revision or model token, an over-bound declared count before it
//! allocates the step list, and truncated, dropped, extra, unknown-rule, out-of-range and
//! non-decimal tokens.
//!
//! [`check`] is stated over **admitted** endpoints. Admission (`crate::check`) is what
//! establishes the graph premise the Lean soundness theorems take as a hypothesis:
//! operands are defined strictly before their node (a forward reference is
//! `Malformed::ForwardReference`, a dependency cycle `Malformed::Cycle`), every slot is
//! defined once, and no node is dangling. The checker additionally refuses any step whose
//! premise reads a node at or after the rewritten node, so a cyclic or forward-referencing
//! step is malformed even when the caller skipped admission.
//!
//! This is the Rust side of the lane modelled in
//! `proofs/foundation/NobleFoundation/GraphRewrite.lean`; the model's rule,
//! congruence and checker-soundness theorems are stated over the Lean graph
//! denotation, and the fixed fixture is kernel-checked in the generated
//! `CertificateCorpus.lean`. No correspondence theorem binds this module's code (as
//! opposed to that fixture) to the model. Chained derivations, budgets, retained
//! evidence sizes and every `F32`, guard, effect or resource rewrite remain open.
