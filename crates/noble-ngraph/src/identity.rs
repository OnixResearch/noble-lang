//! Injected identity hashing (design D2).
//!
//! The library builds every identity as a domain-separated, length-prefixed
//! byte stream and feeds it to a scheme supplied by the composition root. It
//! never names or implements a hash function itself, so it has no
//! third-party dependency. `noble-cli` and `noble-ngraph-experiment`
//! implement the scheme with BLAKE3; a hash identifies bytes and proves
//! nothing.
