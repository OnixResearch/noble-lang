//! `Numeric-Graph-v1`: the pure library of the opt-in numeric graph profile
//! (`NumericGraph-Design`, design changes `numeric-graph-profile` and
//! `numeric-graph-v1`).
//!
//! `F32` graphs are authored directly in `ngraph-ir/0` and admitted only by
//! [`check`] (option B0(b)); source extraction exists for `I64` only. The
//! crate is `no_std` + `alloc`, executes no filesystem, process, environment,
//! clock, thread or output effect, and depends only on `noble-kernel` and
//! `noble-contracts`. Identity hashing is injected ([`identity`]).
//!
//! Non-claims: finite tests and evaluator agreement do not prove the
//! extractor (NG-PO-A), the checker (NG-PO-B), the evaluators (NG-PO-C), the
//! binary32 model (NG-PO-D) or any other NG-PO obligation. No performance
//! claim is made.
