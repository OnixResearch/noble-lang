//! Bounded CPU batch evaluation of independent rows (issue #41).
//!
//! The reference model is `proofs/foundation/NobleFoundation/BatchRows.lean`: a row is one wrapping
//! `I64` operation over two explicit operands, and a batch is the *ordered map* of independent
//! single-row runs, so partial progress is the ordered map over the prefix and a refused row can
//! never change another row's result.
//!
//! This module is the tested implementation of that shape, not a proof of it. Rows delegate to the
//! same `sem::i64_*` reference operations the single-row paths use, so a row's result is the
//! documented K-NUM-01 wrapping result rather than a second evaluator. The model's literal-range
//! refusals cannot occur in `i64`, which is why `evaluate` is total; the refusal rows of the model
//! are therefore **not** exercised here and no correspondence claim covers them.
//!
//! [`Prepared`] is the graph-backed entry point: one checked `I64` graph compiled once, then run
//! over ordered input rows through the existing packed interpreter
//! ([`crate::compiled::Compiled::evaluate_in`]) with one reused register workspace. Each row's
//! report is the report of an independent single-row run, and limits are checked before any row
//! runs. It adds no arithmetic of its own, and its rows are compared against independent runs by
//! tests, not proved against `BatchRows.lean`.
