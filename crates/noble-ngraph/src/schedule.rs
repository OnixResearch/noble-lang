//! Independent validation of the **actual packed instruction stream** against its checked graph
//! (issue #43, the graph-to-packed-schedule edge).
//!
//! [`crate::layout`] validates a *declaration*: register map, constant and slot tables, register
//! count, layer ranges and failure-suffix minima. Instruction bodies stay the scheduler's own
//! business there, which leaves the real gap this module closes: a stream may name the right
//! registers and still compute the wrong operation, the wrong operand order or the wrong
//! destination.
//!
//! The relation checked here is the Rust counterpart of the Lean model's `bodiesMatch` and
//! `operandsDefined` over the total I64/Bool fragment
//! (`proofs/foundation/NobleFoundation/PackedSchedule.lean`):
//!
//! - **Declarations first.** `layout::check` runs here, so a caller cannot validate bodies against
//!   a layout that was never admitted, and its refusal keeps its own class.
//! - **Ordered bodies.** The stream is in layer order and each layer's instruction-emitting nodes
//!   are in canonical order, so position `i` must be *exactly* the body the graph node at position
//!   `i` supplies under the declared register map: operation identity, ordered source registers and
//!   destination register. Operand order is part of the body, so a swapped-operand stream is
//!   refused instead of accepted because both registers happen to be reachable.
//! - **Shape.** The stream length is exactly the number of instruction-emitting nodes. That each
//!   declared layer range holds exactly that layer's count is a declaration obligation, refused
//!   by `layout::check` as `Declarations(LayerCoverage)`.
//! - **A caller's cap.** [`check_within`] refuses inputs whose [`declared_work`] exceeds a cap as
//!   `Exhausted`, before reading anything but their lengths; within the cap it is [`check`].
//!
//! Definition-before-use, single-writer registers and ordered output retention are *implied* by
//! those obligations for this slice rather than checked a second time: the graph is acyclic, the
//! declared register map is injective over the scheduled nodes, and a matching body names its own
//! node's register as destination. A slice with reordering freedom inside a layer, or with guards
//! that write, would have to check them explicitly; this is stated so a future slice cannot
//! inherit the implication by accident.
//!
//! Not covered: F32 (it needs #38's expectations and its own semantics), guard ordering beyond the
//! bodies, any byte-level decoding (there is no decoder here), and anything about the Rust
//! compiler, the host or the engine.
