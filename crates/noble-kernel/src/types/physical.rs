//! `Ty::size` counts the declared, logical constructors a type names: one per
//! variant layer, whatever the representation. Copying a value is a different
//! quantity. A generic descriptor stores its arguments *and* a descriptor
//! built from copies of those arguments, so one nesting layer doubles the
//! owned nodes while the logical size grows by one. The kernel therefore keeps
//! the declared size for its limits and measures a copy against this physical
//! count before it makes the copy.
